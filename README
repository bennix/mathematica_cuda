This project demonstrates the use of CUDA libraries and the accessing of user CUDA code from Mathematica via MathLink.

This has been tested with Mathematica 7.0.1 and CUDA 2.2 and above under Linux and Mac (and not yet for Windows).

System Requirements Mac OS X:
  CUDA-enabled GPU
  Mac OS X v. 10.5.2 or later
  The gcc compiler and toolchain installed via Xcode
  CUDA toolkit
  Mathematica
  
  Several environment variables need to be defined in the installation:
  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain /usr/local/cuda/lib.

System Requirments Linux:
  CUDA-enabled GPU
  Fedora 10, RHEL 4.7 & 5.3, SLED 10.2 & 11.0, OpenSUSE 11.1 or Ubuntu 8.10 & 9.04
  CUDA toolkit
  Mathematica

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain /usr/local/cuda/lib.
