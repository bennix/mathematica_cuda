This project demonstrates the use of CUDA libraries and the accessing of user CUDA code from Mathematica via MathLink.

This has been tested with Mathematica 7.0.1 and CUDA 2.3 under Linux (32-bit and 64-bit) and Mac. For Windows use cmake together with FindCuda and FindMathLink).

System Requirements Mac OS X:
  CUDA-enabled GPU
  Mac OS X v. 10.5.2 or later
  The gcc compiler and toolchain installed via Xcode
  CUDA toolkit 2.3
  Mathematica
  
  Following environment variable needs to be defined in the installation:
  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain /usr/local/cuda/lib.

System Requirments Linux:
  CUDA-enabled GPU
  Fedora 10, RHEL 4.7 & 5.3, SLED 10.2 & 11.0, OpenSUSE 11.1 or Ubuntu 8.10 & 9.04
  CUDA toolkit 2.3
  Mathematica

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain /usr/local/cuda/lib (32-bit) or /usr/local/cuda/lib64 (64-bit).
