This project demonstrates the use of CUDA libraries and the accessing of user CUDA code from Mathematica.

This has been tested with Mathematica 7.0.1 and CUDA 2.2 under Linux and Mac (and not yet for Windows).

System Requirements Mac OS X:
  CUDA-enabled GPU
  Mac OS X v. 10.5.2 or later
  The gcc compiler and toolchain installed via Xcode
  CUDA software
  Mathematica
  
Several environment variables need to be defined in the installation:
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to contain /usr/local/cuda/lib.
